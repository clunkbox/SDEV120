Exercise #1
===========

// This is a guessing game. The program asks the user to guess a number between 1 
// and 100 then the program outputs if the guess is too high or too low.  
// The process continues until the player guesses the correct number.

start

    declare num answer=34   // declaring the varible for the correct guess.
    

        //Use a loop to see if the guess equals the correct guess
        //!= means does not equal
        
        do while userGuess != answer                               
            
                input userGuess //Ask the user to guess between 1 and 100.            

                //If statement to determine if guess is lower than answer
                if userGuess < answer then                       
                    print "The answer is too low. Try Again."  
                //Else statement to determine if guess is higer than answer
                 else userGuess > answer then                    
                    print "The answer is too high. Try Again."
                endif

       end loop //Answer is correct so the loop ends
   
    //Once loop ends program outputs this message.
    print "THAT'S CORRECT!! GOOD JOB!!"                         
        
stop


Exercise #2
===========

// This is a program that looks up in a dictionary

start

     //Declaring a variable the word we are searching for.
    //Delcaring a variable for the Word that we are looking at 
    //in the dictionary

    declare findWord                                        
    declare dictionaryWord                                   
        
         //Use a loop to determine if we are looking at the desired word
         // != means does not equal
        
        do while findWord != cup                           
         
            //if statment to determine which direction we need to look
            if dictionaryWord comes before findWord then    
                go forward one word
            else
                go back a word 
            endif
    
        end loop    //End loop once the word is found

    output the definition  

stop
